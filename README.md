Theme:
The theme of this project is a simple website about minimalist gold jewelry.
The website includes four pages and is built entirely with HTML to keep the structure clear and easy to understand.

File Organization:
The project contains four HTML files: the homepage, the about page, the services page, and the contact page.
All images used throughout the website are placed inside an assets/images folder to keep the project organized.
Each page uses only the files it needs, and all image paths are taken from this folder.

Challenges:
The main challenges I faced were working with HTML tags such as <details> and <summary> and deciding the best place to use them in the layout.
Adding images and writing correct file paths also required attention.
Organizing all files properly and arranging them correctly in GitHub was another step that needed care.
